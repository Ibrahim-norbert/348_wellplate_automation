The simulator is provided to allow developent in the absence of a Dragonfly (500) or Damselfly (200) unit.
It will help the developer to test their implementation in a safe controlled manner.
The simulator requires a simple RS232 to RS232 connection, the simulator connects to one port and the SDK  the other.
The simulator will respond to all commands as per real unit, allowing testing to be completed before moving to the hardware.

This can be achieved using a simple USB to multiple RS232 device, with an RS232 cable connecting each port.
There are software alternatives (virtual comports) but we do not warrant such drivers, so leave the developer to explore that avenue if so desired.

There are 2 configuration provided, Dragonfly and Damselfy, copy the relevant file to the root folder before starting the application.
This will help to simulate and full test each devce type.
Note - You cannot swap the ini file while the simulator is open (even when disconnected).
