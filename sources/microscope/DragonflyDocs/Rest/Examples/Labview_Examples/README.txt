Requires the following package to be installed through VI Package Manager:
	JKI HTTP REST Client

To run:
	Open examples.lvproj in Labview
	Run full/TwoProtocolLoop.vi

This VI does nothing but delay in between running the protocols.  You can replace these delays with more useful activity, such as sending/waiting for TTL signals.
